# Tic Tac Toe 

## Rules

* Two players take turns, clicking on a tile within the game board to place their marker.

* The player to achieve three consecutive marks horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins.

* The 'meow' button is a lifeline of sorts, if you chose to use it, it will select a random empty tile and designate it as your opponents tile before returning to your turn. This may only be used once, and not on the first turn.
